I chose this specific tool because of its ability to process complex instructions and provide real-time suggestions.\n\nHow did the GenAI tool help you in completing the assessment (with examples)?\n\nThe tool provided drafts that I could refine, saving me time on initial content creation.\n\nWhat do you think are challenging about the tool?\n\nWhile GenAI is excellent at generating text, I had to be careful to review and edit the output to ensure it accurately reflected my thoughts.\n\nHow do you think will GenAI tools assist you for your future study or work?\n\n\nSummarizing large volumes of research to identify key themes quickly\nPeer-reviewing my own reports\nLearning new technical concepts by asking it to explain complex topics in simpler terms."

My rationale was to add clear color coding to represent different grade ranges, making it easier to identify students’ performance at a glance. The use of distinct colors for each grade bracket helps in quickly assessing the overall class performance and identifying areas where students may need additional support."
