I used Gemini, a generative AI developed by Google. I chose this specific tool because of its ability to process complex instructions and provide real-time suggestions.

<h2>How did the GenAI tool help you in completing the assessment (with examples)?</h2>
The tool provided drafts that I could refine, saving me time on initial content creation.

<h2>What do you think are challenging about the tool?</h2>
While GenAI is excellent at generating text, I had to be careful to review and edit the output to ensure it accurately reflected my thoughts.

<h2>How do you think will GenAI tools assist you for your future study or work?</h2>
- Summarizing large volumes of research to identify key themes quickly
- Peer-reviewing my own reports
- Learning new technical concepts by asking it to explain complex topics in simpler terms.
